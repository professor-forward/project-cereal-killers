## Deliverable 2

 In our project, there are several folders in order to contain the html file, images, css file, and javascript files.

In Deliverable 3, we **completely** redesigned ui, which is much clearer and simplified than our deliverable 2.

The main files of this project are in **cupid_arrow/src** folder

#### UI design AND some function

In our UI design, there are 5 sections: 

**Login page**: In this page, it requires user to enter the valid email address and password ( No less than 8 characters ).

**Home page**: The main page that the user interacts with the web page. Here, the user can swipe the card in the middle to like or dislike people. The card displays the photo, name, and some other information about this person.If the user swipe the card to the **right** which means **like** this person in the card, And If the user swipe the card to the **left** means **dislike** this person

**Profile page**: for the user to update and fill in their information.**Chat page**: for the user to chat with other people who are interested in

 ## Deliverable 2

 In our project, there are several folders in order to contain the html file, images, css file, and javascript files.

 There are two major files that are in use for the UI design, 
the index.html file: 

[index.html](https://github.com/professor-forward/project-cereal-killers/blob/main/Project/index.html)

And the cssfile.css file:

[cssfile.css](https://github.com/professor-forward/project-cereal-killers/blob/main/Project/css/cssfile.css)


In our UI design, there are 5 sections:

**Home page**

**Intro page**: page to introduce how to use the web page.

**Explore page**: page designed for the user to encounter strangers.

**Matches page**: page to show the user information about who liked him/her back.

**My profile page**: page for the user to update and fill in their information.
